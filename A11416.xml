            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:11275:5"/> the names of theſe fower cardinal points, ſomwhat hath bene ſaid vpon diſcourſe of the windes in the 2 day of the firſt weeke, verſe 571. The order of the ſonnes of <hi>Noe</hi> is this. <hi>Iaphet</hi> is the elder, <hi>Sem</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Cham</hi> the laſt. Gen. 9.24 &amp; 10.21. But <hi>Sem</hi> is named firſt, becauſe of the fauour of God ſhewed to his poſteritie, by thence raiſing the Meſſias, &amp; there main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his Church. <hi>Iaphet</hi> the ſecond, for that in the vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Gentiles he is receiued into the tents of <hi>Sem,</hi> that is, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to the familie of the faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the prophecy &amp; bleſſing of <hi>Noe</hi> Gen. 9.27. Now in the 10 of Gen. v. 25. <hi>Moſes</hi> further affirmeth, that <hi>Heber Sems</hi> vnder-nephew had two ſonnes, the one named <hi>Peleg,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> or <hi>parting aſunder</hi> (for in his time the earth was diuided) and the other <hi>Ioktan.</hi> Whereout ſome gather, that in the time of <hi>Peleg,</hi> that is (as I take it) before the confuſion of tongues, <hi>Noe</hi> and his ſonnes reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred the graunt that God had made them of all the earth: and that <hi>Noe</hi> then made a kind of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof among his ſonnes. If wee recken the confuſion of the builders, together with the partition of the world, though about the fiftieth yeare of <hi>Peleg,</hi> who was borne but an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after the ſloud, and liued 239, this confuſion muſt happen within 150 yeares after the flood: which were verie ſoone: yet ſome take it ſooner, as from the time that <hi>Peleg</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued his name, for remembrance (as they ſay) of both things ſo note-worthie to all poſteritie, and eſpecially to the Church of God: which well might be aduertiſed thereof; for <hi>Peleg</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued 46 yeares after the birth of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as appeareth by the 11. chapter of Geneſis. Two things then are here to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: the one, that the partition of the earth which <hi>Noe</hi> made, was to his poſteritie a token of Gods great bleſſing, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe the Babel-builders for their part haue turned into a curſe: the other, that this partition (as manie diuines and Chroniclers thinke) was made before <hi>Nymrod</hi> and his traine came out of the Eaſt, and ſate downe in the plaine of Sennaar, what time they were ſcattered thence againe by the confuſion. Whereunto this I will adioyne, that as then the builders lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was confounded: ſo by continuance of time, the ſpeech 
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:11275:6"/> of others alſo was corrupted, eſpecially when they began to forget the true religion, which euen in <hi>Sems</hi> familie was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, as appeareth plainly out of the 24 chap. of Ioſua, where it is ſaid that <hi>Terah</hi> father to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Nachor</hi> had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſtrange gods. It was no reaſon that the holy tong ſhould remaine entire and vncorrupt with ſuch as had corrupted the ſeruice of God. But the Lord being mercifull vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> reſtored to him againe, and kept for his faithfull children the firſt language, which had not bene ſo much corrupted in the familie of <hi>Sem,</hi> who parted not ſo farre from his father.</p>

                        <hi>Now Iaphet. Moſes</hi> reciting Geneſis, 9.27, how <hi>Noe</hi> bleſſed his two children, ſets downe two notable points, the one concerning the great and many countries which <hi>Iaphet</hi> and his poſterity ſhould poſſeſſe: the other of the fauour that God ſhould ſhew them, by lodging them in the tents of <hi>Sem,</hi> that is, by receiuing them at length into his church; which hath beene fulfilled in the calling of the Gentiles. For the firſt poynt, whereas hee ſayth, <hi>God enlarge Iaphet</hi> (For ſo the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew word ſignifieth, although ſome tranſlate it <hi>Perſuade</hi>) it is as much as if hee had ſaid, Let <hi>Iaphet</hi> and his race poſſeſſe the countries round about him farre and neere. And this hath alſo beene accompliſhed in that ſo infinite a multitude of people hath iſſued out of the ſtocke of <hi>Iaphet,</hi> and peopled Europe; which, though it appeare leſſer then the other parts, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies had more inhabitants and fewer void countries. The Poet hath ſet downe ſo parfite a deſcription thereof, as it needs no further to bee opened, if the Reader haue neuer ſo little beheld the Mappes. On the Eaſt it is parted from the greater <hi>Aſia</hi> by the <hi>Maior</hi> Sea, the <hi>Meotis</hi> Lake, called by <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telius</hi> the <hi>Zabach</hi> ſea, the Riuer <hi>Tane</hi> or <hi>Don,</hi> which voids into the Lake, and the Spring-heads of <hi>Rha, Edel,</hi> or <hi>Volga,</hi> running by <hi>Tartarie</hi> into the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea: and from <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſſe, ſometime the honour of the world and exceeding rich, as ſtill it hath ſufficient, it is deuided by the Straight of <hi>Gallipoli,</hi> ſometime called <hi>Helleſpent.</hi> On the Weſt it hath the

So doth here the Poet, notſtanding much vpon the order of them, to follow the verſe; of <hi>Gomer</hi> are come the Gomerites, whom the Greekes called Galates &amp; Gaules: of them came the people that ſpoiled <hi>Delphos,</hi> and then ſate downe about <hi>Troas</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and were called Gaule-Greekes, or Aſian Galates, who afterward ſeized a good part of <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia.</hi> The Lord threatning by Exechiel, 38. chapter; <hi>Gog</hi> cheife of the Princes of <hi>Meſech</hi> and <hi>Tubal,</hi> ſayth he, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him with this <hi>Gomer</hi> and all his bandes, and the houſe of <hi>Togarmah</hi> of the North-quarters. They that expound the propheſie gather out of this place that the Gomerites were people bordering on the North of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and brought by the Kings of Syria and Aſia to deſtroy the Iewes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their returne from <hi>Babylon.</hi> They preaſed foorth of <hi>Aſia</hi> and enlarged their dominions greatly (as hath been ſaied) for they were a very warlike Nation. Of them the Poet ſayth are come the <hi>Germanes,</hi> ſo <hi>Melancthon</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vpon <hi>Carion,</hi> ſo doe others alſo, and chiefly <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropius</hi> in his fift booke. But there is great diuerſitie in theſe outworne matters, betweene the late and auncient writers. A diligent conference of places in the old Teſtament, and the ancient Latine, Greeke, and Chaldean tranſlations ſerue beſt for the purpoſe: next a carefull examining of the beſt 
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:11275:11"/> Greeke &amp; Latine hiſtories: but this requires a whole volume, whereunto the ſearches of <hi>Goropius,</hi> being ſo well handled, might affoord a man great helpe. Concerning <hi>Tubal</hi> the Poet followes the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> that he was author of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh: which muſt be rightly vnderſtood, that is, after a long tract of time. For by the 38 and 39 of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> it ſeemes that the people iſſued from <hi>Tubal</hi> and <hi>Moſoch,</hi> that were neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, dwelt neare <hi>Arabia,</hi> and were gouerned or led to war by the king of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Syria.</hi> And in the 32 chapter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where is mention made of the mourning that ſhould be among the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the king of Egypt, there are named among others, <hi>Aſhur, Elam, Moſoch</hi> and <hi>Tubal:</hi> wherby it may be gathered they were of <hi>Aſia.</hi> As for their Colonies and outcreaſes into <hi>Spaine,</hi> they are verie darke and hardly proued. <hi>Vaſaeus</hi> indeed in his Chronicle of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Taraphe</hi> in his hiſtorie, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that haue written of <hi>Spaine</hi> in diuerſe languages, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Beroſe,</hi> make <hi>Tubal</hi> firſt king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> but ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence they declare not what time he came thither, I leaue the reader to conſider-of &amp; ſearch further into the matter. Looke the hiſtoricall Librarie of <hi>N. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ignier,</hi> the firſt part, page 15. where he treateth of the people of <hi>Europe.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Magog</hi> as the Poet ſaith, is father of the <hi>Scythians:</hi> his firſt habitation and Colonie was in <hi>Coeleſyria,</hi> as may be gathered out of the fift booke and 23 chapter of <hi>Plinie,</hi> and the 37.38 and 39 chapters of <hi>Ezechiel.</hi> At this time the right <hi>Scythians</hi> are the <hi>Sclauonians, Moſceuites</hi> and <hi>Tartarians,</hi> who vaunt of their deſcent from <hi>Iaphet.</hi> This might haue bene by tract of time, but not ſo ſoone, as the Poet in the ſequele. <hi>Melancthon</hi> in his firſt vpon <hi>Carion</hi> takes the prophecies againſt <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> to be meant eſpecially of the Turkes, whom he calleth by the name of <hi>Scythians,</hi> and applieth alſo vnto them that which is written in the Reuelation. And in the end of his ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d booke he giues the name to all people that profeſſe <hi>Mahomet.</hi> I thinke my ſelfe, that, ſome while after <hi>Noes</hi> partition of the lands, <hi>Magog</hi> and his people dwelt in <hi>Coeleſyria</hi> or therabouts, and thence by ſucceſſion of time thruſt vp into the higher cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys. Now as the ancient people of God were much vexed &amp; 
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:11275:12"/> outraged by the kings of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſucceſſors of <hi>Seleucus Nicanor,</hi> and ſignified by the name of <hi>Gog,</hi> who aiding the people of <hi>Magog, Moſoch</hi> and <hi>Tubal</hi> their ſubiects, greatly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed the Iewes then returned from <hi>Babylon:</hi> ſo hath Satan in theſe later dayes againſt the holy Citie, the Church of God, ſtirred vp againe <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> many kings and Princes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to the faith, who haue conſpired together, and made a League to ouerthrow it vtterly: but th' Almightie in due time and ſeaſon ſhall confound them. Reade the 20 Chapter of the Reuelation, and the 89 Sermon of <hi>Bullinger</hi> thereupon.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Moſoch, Ioſeph</hi> ſaith, of him are come the <hi>Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> and for proofe thereof alleageth a certaine towne of their countrey called <hi>Mazaca.</hi> It may be gathered out of the 120. Pſalme, that <hi>Meſech</hi> or <hi>Moſoch</hi> was a neighbour people to <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> which place the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſt expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, vſeth words of this import: <hi>O wretch that I am! for I haue bene a ſtranger among the Aſians, and dwelt in th' Arabiantents.</hi> The Poet conſidereth what might haue bene in continuance of time, &amp; how farre the mans poſteritie might haue ſtretched.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Madai</hi> ſure was author of the name of <hi>Medes,</hi> whoſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was verie great in the higher <hi>Aſia;</hi> they deſtroyed the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Monarchie, as may be noted out of Ieremy 51.11. &amp; Dan. 5.18.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Thracians</hi> (<hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſaith, and the Poet) are deſcended of <hi>Thyras.

His reaſons are, firſt, that hils, riuers and ſeas change their names, as by <hi>Ortelius</hi> his <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Geography</hi> doth appeare, comparing the bookes and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of <hi>Ptolomie, Strabo, Mela,</hi> &amp; other ancients, with the maps of <hi>Gemma Friſius, Vopelius, Mercator, Poſtel, Theuet, Cellarius</hi> and other late writers. Secondly, that cities and countreys are not alwayes called by the names of their founders and firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. Thirdly, that no ſtocke or nation hath ſure hold of any place in the world, becauſe of the many chaunges that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall this life. Fourthly, that as in the ſea one waue thruſteth on another, ſo the people, and chiefly thoſe of old time, haue dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen each other out of place, and in a maner played, In docke out nettle. All ſtories proue theſe reaſons to be true, &amp; for the laſt, the Author ſhewes three notable examples to confirme it.</p>

Now therefore he ſaith it is the ſafer way to follow and keepe neare the verge of the foreſt, rather then venter too far into it. He ſhewes thereby, that his meaning is to giue vs a generall view of theſe matters, not curiouſly to minſe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, as they haue done, who vndertake to gather out of Authors, and teach others the courſe of <hi>Noes</hi> poſteritie euerie mile as they haue runne vntill this preſent; and pore ſtill into the Arke, to finde there the names of their countrymen and aunceſtours. Therefore he voweth to relye wholly vpon <hi>the golden mouth of Moſes,</hi> which was the ſonne of <hi>Amram,</hi> as the Scripture witneſſeth, Nomb. 26.59. Now <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith Geneſ. 10. in the ende of the Chapter, That of the children of <hi>Noe</hi> were the Nations deuided on the earth after the flood. And before in 5.20. and 30. verſes, he ſheweth plainly from whence they began to people the world, and (as it were) to leade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the Arke ouer the face of the earth: in filling moſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes of the world with their great poſteritie, encreaſed, as it was, by vertue of Gods wonderful bleſſing.

                        <hi>But all this other world.</hi> This is the firſt of the foreſayde queſtions: how it came to paſſe that the new world, diſcouered in theſe latter times, could be ſo repleniſhed with people, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (who haue thereof written very much) did finde it. He ſpeaketh of the <hi>West Jndia,</hi> which is called <hi>another world,</hi> or the new world, for the hugenes thereof; being more then 9300. leagues about, as <hi>Gomara</hi> ſaith in his <hi>Indian</hi> Hiſtorie 1. book. 12. chap. it is longer then all the other three parts of the world: and two or three waies as broad as <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> laide together. This quarter, ſo great and full of kingdomes and people, if it haue been long agone inhabited, how hap (ſaith our Poet) the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Greekes,</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> who vndertooke ſo many farre voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, came neuer there, nor once heard thereof? For <hi>Ptolomee, Strabo, Mela</hi> and other auncient writers make no mention of it: and if it were peopled but of late yeares, he asketh, how came ſo many people there, ſo many great cities and ſtately monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as <hi>Gomara, Benzo, Cieque, Ouiede, Cortes,</hi> and others write of. <hi>Benzo</hi> and <hi>Barthelemi de las Caſas</hi> doe report, that, in that little the <hi>Spaniards</hi> haue there gotten within theſe 30. or 40. yeres, they haue ſlaine aboue twentie millions of people, vndone and brought to great diſtreſſe as many or more, and waſted and vnpeopled twiſe as much ground as is contained in <hi>Europe</hi> and a part of <hi>Aſia</hi> to that. Neuertheleſſe in many places, and euen in <hi>Mexico, New Spaine</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> where they haue vſed all the crueltie, wickednes and villanie that mans heart or the diuels rage could imagine, there are yet liuing many thouſand <hi>Indians.</hi> Concerning the auncient Monuments of this new world, I will reckon at this time but one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, taken out of the fourth booke and 194. chapter of <hi>Gomara:</hi> there are (ſaith hee) in <hi>Peru</hi> two great high-waies reaching, the one through the hilles, the other ouer the plaines, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Quito</hi> to <hi>Cuſco,</hi> which is aboue 500. leagues out right, a worke ſo great and chargeable, that it is well worthie 
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:11275:28"/> noting: that ouer the plaines, is 25. foote broad, and walled on either ſide, and hath little brookes running along in it, with ſtore of the trees called <hi>Molli</hi> planted on the bankes. The other is of like breadth, cutting thorough the rocks, and filling vp the lower grounds with ſtone worke: for they are both of them leuell without mounting or deſcending any hill, &amp; ſtraight without ſtopping at any lake or poole. In a word, whoſoeuer hath ſeene either of them, will ſay it is a work farre ſurpaſsing all the great buildings and paued cauſies of the Romanes, or the walles of <hi>Babylon</hi> built by Queene <hi>Semyramis,</hi> or thoſe moſt wonderfull <hi>Pyramides</hi> of <hi>Aegypt. Guaynacapa,</hi> a certaine king of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians (who liued about 100. yeares agoe) cauſed theſe wayes to be repayred and enlarged; but he was not the firſt beginner of them, as ſome would make vs beleeue: for he could not haue fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them in all his life time, and the ſtone-worke ſeemes to be much more ancient. There are built vpon them, a dayes iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney aſunder, many goodly pallaces, called <hi>Tambos,</hi> wherein the Court and armies of the Princes wont to lodge. But, <hi>Gomara</hi> ſayth, our Spanyards haue by their ciuil warres vtterly deſtroyed theſe cauſies, and cut them aſunder in many places, that they might not come one to the other: yea the Indians themſelues haue broke-off and ſeuered their parts in time of warre. Now let vs heare the Poets anſwere.</p>

                        <hi>Indeed this mightie ground.</hi> This new-found world is called <hi>America,</hi> of the name of <hi>Americus Vespuſius,</hi> a certaine famous Pilot of <hi>Florence,</hi> one of the firſt diſcouerers of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, not much more then a hundred yeares agoe. His ſecond an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere is, that this part of the world could not bee ſo ſoone enha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited as the other three: becauſe it is diſcoaſted further from the plaine of <hi>Sennaar,</hi> for in <hi>Aſia</hi> the plaine it ſelfe was. And <hi>Arabia</hi> being peopled, <hi>Affrick</hi> was very neere at hand, and <hi>Europe</hi> from the leſſer <hi>Aſia</hi> is parted but with a narrow <hi>Phare:</hi> whereas <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi> is farre beyond all theſe which way ſoeuer we coaſt.

From this fable ſeemes to be drawne the name of <hi>Bosphore:</hi> which is as much to ſay as <hi>Bull-ferrie.</hi> Perhaps this <hi>Iupiter</hi> was ſome notable pyrate or tyrant thereabout raigning, who in a Ship called the Bull, ſtole away ſome yong Lady &amp; fled for ſafetie into <hi>Europe.</hi> Theſe words <hi>(which from cold Bosphors head Doth reach the pearly dew of Tithons ſaffran bed)</hi> ſet down the length of <hi>Aſia,</hi> that is, from the <hi>Bosphore</hi> of <hi>Thrace</hi> vnto the Eaſt-Ocean. <hi>The Caſtile armes and lore:</hi> that is, the Spaniſh Religion and forces, which <hi>Christopher Columbus</hi> brought firſt into <hi>America,</hi> and there planted in the name of the Spaniſh king.</p>

                        <hi>But there the buildings.</hi> The third anſwere is, that the ſtately buildings, infinite treaſures, &amp; diuers gouernements that are there, will witnes that the countrie hath been long enhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, although hard it is to learne how. I haue alreadie ſpoke of the great Cauſeyes of <hi>Peru.</hi> Now the ſumptuouſnes of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtetan,</hi> the great citie of the kingdome of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and the kings Pallaces of <hi>Peru</hi> (ſuch they are deſcribed by the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards) make further proofe of the Poets ſaying. As forth vncoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table 
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:11275:29"/> wealth of the <hi>Indies</hi> it plainely appeares, that aboue ten thouſand Myllions of golde haue been brought thence into <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> beſide heapes of Rubies, Emeraudes and Pearle, much wracked in the ſea, and much brought for a yearly tribute into <hi>Spaine.</hi> Whereunto I will adde what <hi>Franciſcus Lopes de Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mara</hi> ſaith concerning the vnualuable riches of <hi>Guainacapa,</hi> (the name ſignifieth <hi>young and rich</hi>) the father of <hi>Antibalippa,</hi> laſt king of <hi>Peru,</hi> whom the Spaniards put to death. <hi>All the furniture of his houſe, table and kitchin</hi> (ſaith hee in the 120. chapter of his fourth booke) <hi>were of golde aend ſiluer, and the meanest of ſiluer ſomewhat embaſed with copper for the more ſtrength. He had in his wardrop giant-like images of golde liuely featured; as alſo all kinde of beasts, foules, trees, herbes, and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that the land there beareth; and all kinde of fiſhes, that either the Sea there, or any freſh water of his kingdome breedeth, in the ſaid mettals well and proportionably reſembled, not ſo much as cordes, paniers, troughes, billets, and other ſuch implements, but were ſo; to conclude, there was nothing in his kingdome, whereof he had not the counterfet in golde or ſiluer. Jt is alſo ſaid that the kings of Peru, called Ingaes, haue a garden in a certaine Iſle neere Puna, where they delight themſelues when they list take the Sea, that hath in golde and ſiluer all hearbes, flowers and trees, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things whatſoeuer meet for a pleaſant garden: ſuch a ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deuiſe, as neuer was heard-of or ſeene elſewhere. Beſides all this, that king, last but one, had gathered into Cuſco huge maſſes of golde and ſiluer vnfined: which the Indians hid ſo ſecretly, as the Spaniards could neuer come-by it, there was alſo in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Cuſco great ſtore of picture-tables and tombes all of fine ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, worth ſome thirtie, ſome fifty, ſome threeſcore thouſand du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats a peece: alſo dining-tables, veſſels, and images a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, all of fine golde. The Spaniards at the taking of Antiba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippa found as good as 252000. poundes of ſiluer, and of golde 1300265. pezoes, euery pezo valued at a ducat and a halfe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the great golden table of Antibalippa, worth nye 40000. Crownes.</hi> Now for all this great ſpoyle that the Spaniards got, and hauock that they made, as well in <hi>Peru,</hi> as other the Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereabout, yet the Indians (as <hi>Benzo</hi> reports, who ſtayde 
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:11275:29"/> there with the Spaniards foureteene yeares, and wrote in three bookes worthy-reading that whole ſtorie) they ſticke not to ſay, they haue yet more remaining then all that the Spaniards euer had. And to make their meaning plainer, they will take out of a great veſſell full of wheate one graine betwixt their fingers, and ſay: <hi>See you this? the Viracochie</hi> (ſo they call the Spaniards) <hi>haue taken as it were this one graine away: but thus much</hi> (ſay they, poynting to the reſt in the veſſel) <hi>thus much and more haue they left behinde them.</hi> Now the word <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iracochie</hi> becauſe it comes thus in my way, <hi>Benzo</hi> himſelfe in his third booke ſaith, it ſignifies <hi>the frother ſcumme of the Sea:</hi> and that the <hi>Peruvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſo call the Spaniards for deepe hatred and abomination of them; ſaying alſo ſometimes one to another in their language: <hi>The winde bears downe houſes and trees, and the fire burnes them, but theſe</hi> Viracochie <hi>they doe worſe then winde and fire. They waste all, they eate all, they turne the earth and all vpſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downe: they turne the courſe of riuers: they are neuer at quiet: they neuer ceaſe ranging vp and downe to ſeeke golde and ſiluer: and all they finde is too little for them. When they haue it, what doe they? They take their pleaſure, they warre one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, rob one another, kill one another: they are euer giuen to lying, blaspheming, and denying the ſame God whom they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe: and theſe men haue cruelly ſlaine without cauſe our fathers, our children and kinsfolkes, taken from vs, contrarie to all right, our goods, our libertie and countrie.</hi> Hauing thus commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Spaniards, they curſe the Sea for vomiting on the Earth ſo cruell and wicked a people, and often haue vpbrayded the Spaniards themſelues with this notorious reproach: that golde was the Chriſtians God. O how ſhall this people in the latter day condemne that euer-greedy couetouſnes, for which <hi>Europe</hi> nowadayes heareth ſo ill, and is by the ſelfe-people thereof ſo waſted and vnpeopled! But concerning the diuers gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>West Indies,</hi> ſeeing they are ſet downe ſo well at large by <hi>Lopes, Ouiede, Benzo</hi> and others, it is too great a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for mee to handle in this diſcourſe, which is (I feare mee) growne to long alreadie: therefore will I draw to an ende. The Poet at the 413. verſe begins to ſhew ſome likely opinions how 
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:11275:30"/> this new-founde worlde was peopled: and firſt in generall, that the people of countries enhabited, exerciſing their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trafficke one with another, might ſometimes be caſt by force of tempeſt vpon the <hi>Weſt-Indian</hi> ſhore, and ſo be conſtrained (their ſhippes being broken) to remaine ſtill there. Others by plague, warre or famine were driuen to leaue their countries, &amp; ſeeke ſome quieter dwelling farther off, and ſo haue lighted on theſe new Countries. Or perhaps ſome great man of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, or cunning Pilot, by ventring made a diſcouerie thereof, and ledde the ouer-creaſes of ſome people thither. As the Poet ſheweth more particularly in the verſes following.</p>

The cauſe, why here I made exchange of <hi>Chinca,</hi> was firſt for that the Poet had ſpoke before of the ſprings of <hi>Chink,</hi> which I take for the ſame; then becauſe it is ſo diuerſly placed of the Card-men: for <hi>Ortelius,</hi> in his Mappe of the new world, ſets it aboue, and <hi>Theuet</hi> beſide <hi>Chili,</hi> in either place it ſtands well to be taken for the <hi>Chink</hi> afore-named: but <hi>Merca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> placeth it a great deale lower, and on the contrary coaſt, neer the riuer of <hi>Plata,</hi> where indeede is a countrie called <hi>Chica,</hi> that perhaps hath bred this error. Laſtly, <hi>Quintete</hi> ſtands ſo right in way, which the Poet followes, from <hi>Chili</hi> to the <hi>Patagones,</hi> that I thought it not amiſſe to take the ſame rather then the doubtfull <hi>Chinca.</hi> By <hi>the fomy Brack of Magellanus,</hi> he meanes the ſea and Straight of <hi>Magellan</hi> cloſe by <hi>terra Australis. Gomara</hi> deſcribeth it well in the beginning of the third booke of his <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall 
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:11275:31"/> Historie.</hi> The Poet hath alreadie ſhewed how people came firſt on the North-<hi>America</hi> from the kingdome of <hi>Anian</hi> ouer the maine land to th' <hi>Atlantick</hi> ſea ſhore, then on all the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coaſts from <hi>Quiuir</hi> to the <hi>Magellan</hi> Straight, along th' <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chipelago de San Lazaro, Mar del Zur, &amp; Pacifico:</hi> and now he takes the higher ſide on the left hand from the Land-Straight of <hi>Panama</hi> to the riuer of <hi>Plata,</hi> which is not farre from the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellan:</hi> noting by the way the moſt note-worthie places of all this huge reach of ground, repreſented, as it is, by our late writers in their generall and particular Mappes of the New-found world. <hi>Huo</hi> is a great ſweet-water ſtreame riſing at <hi>Quillacin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas,</hi> (that lieth vnder the Equatour) and running athwart the countrie now called <hi>Carthage</hi> into the ſea at <hi>Garia. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>raba</hi> is the countrie that lieth betwixt that riuer and <hi>Carthagene.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Zenu,</hi> marke what <hi>Gomara</hi> ſayth thereof in his ſecond booke and 69. chapter. It is the name of a riuer and citie both, and of a Hauen very large and ſure. The Citie is ſome 8. leagues from the ſea. There is a great Mart for Salt and Fiſh. Gould the inhabitants gather all about; and when they ſet themſelues to get much, they lay fine-wrought nets in the riuer of <hi>Zenu</hi> and others and oftentimes they draw-vp graines of pure gold as big as egges. This countrie is not farre from the Straight of <hi>Darien.</hi> In the ſayd ſecond booke, chap. 72. he deſcribes alſo <hi>Noua Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,</hi> and the Mount of Emeraudes: which is very high, bare, and peeld, without any herbe or tree thereon growing, and lieth ſome fiue degrees on this ſide the Equatour. The Indians, when they goe-about to get the ſtones, firſt vſe many enchauntments to know where the beſt vaine is. The firſt time the Spanyards came there, they drew thence great and little 1800. very fayre and of great price: but for this commoditie, the countrie is ſo barren that the people were faine to feede on Piſmers: till of late the Spaniſh couetouſneſſe hath made them know the value of their Mountaine. <hi>Cumana</hi> is deſcribed in the foreſaid booke, chap. 79. in the ende whereof <hi>Gomara</hi> ſayth the vapours of the Riuer of <hi>Cumana</hi> engender a certaine little miſt or ſlime vpon mens eyes, ſo as the people there are very pore-blind. <hi>Parie</hi> is deſcribed in the 84 chapter of the ſaid ſecond book. <hi>Maragnon,</hi>

Gomara</hi> ſpeaking thereof in the 89. chapter of his ſecond booke ſayth, In this ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is found ſiluer, pearles, and other things of great price. It containes in bredth 25. leagues, makes many Iſlands, and ſwels like <hi>Nilus,</hi> and about the ſelfe-ſame time. It ſpringeth firſt out of the mountaines of <hi>Peru,</hi> and is after encreaſed by the in fall of many riuers: for the countrie thereabout is leuell, or flat, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it ſeemes to haue receiued the name of <hi>Plate.</hi>

                        <hi>O world of ſundry kindes!</hi> Without this diſcourſe, all that went before concerning the worldes enpeopling, were to little purpoſe or none at all, ſaue onely to breede many doubts in the readers vnderſtanding. For a man may aske, How falles it out that the nations of the world, comming all of one father, <hi>Noe,</hi> doe varie ſo much one from another, both in body and minde? The Poet therefore making this obiection, moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be conſidered, giueth alſo anſwere thereunto: firſt in generall, by way of exclamation and maruaile, then in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner, ſetting downe ſome ſpeciall reaſons of this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull diuerſitie, that appeareth in the ſtature, complexion, ſtrength, colour, and cuſtome of people whereſoeuer diſperſed ouer the face of the earth. The firſt and principall cauſe is <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> it ſelfe, that is, the wiſe prouidence of God, marueilous in all his workes. If God had made the earth in all places alike, all flowers of one colour and ſauour, all beaſtes, fowles, fiſhes and creeping things, of one kind; had he made the heauen without ſtarres, or the ſtarres all of one bigneſſe, &amp; men all of the ſame hew, beautie, feature, ſtrength and diſpoſition, as well of body as minde: the diuers colours of his infinite wiſedome had not ſo ſhined in them. But as he is aboue all (yea onely) wiſe, good 
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:11275:38"/> and beautifull, ſo would he in his workes keepe a certaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of his owne perfection, prouoking vs thereby, daily to aduaunce and rayſe our thoughtes vnto the high conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, parfite loue &amp; due reuerence of himſelfe. Now if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider all his workes, the light of his wonderfull glory no where appeareth more, then in the diligent view of Man, who is very fitly called of the Greekes <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>the little world.</hi> For in this little table hath he lymbed-out in orient colours, for all that wil behold, the wonders of his vnſearchable wiſedome: and they are here ſome of them by the Poet well pointed-out. And a wonderfull thing indeed it is, that among ſo many men as haue beene ſince the beginning, are, or ſhall be to the worldes end, there neuer was, nor is, nor can be any one, but differing much from all the reſt, both in body and minde, and in many thinges elſe that enſue thereon. This I am content to note, but in a world, leauing all the particulars of this miracle for the reader priuatly to conſider; that he may wonder the more thereat, and praiſe there according th'almightie Creator, the Soueraigne Good: neither will I now take in hand to diſpute againſt thoſe that in ſearching the cauſes of this diuerſitie, aſcribe all to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or Nature, (as they call it, meaning a ſecret propertie and power of the creatures) or to the ſtarres and other heauenly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; to mans lawes, cuſtome or nouriſhment, in ſtead of God: who is indeed the firſt and onely working cauſe of all things; in whome wee liue, moue and are. This matter woulde require a long diſcourſe: and though the Poet here, beſide the chiefe and onely true cauſe, reckoneth certaine vnder-cauſes; as cuſtome growing to Nature, Th'example of Elders, prouinciall Lawes, and the influence of Starres; it is not his meaning to take from the Lord of Nature this honor due vnto him for the diuerſitie of his wonderfull works: but onely to lay open vnto vs a few ſuch inſtruments as his incomprehenſible wiſedome vſeth, to make vs the better conceiue the manner of his heauenly working. The Philoſophers, Aſtronomers, Phyſicians and Politickes, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe at large vpon theſe differences: he that would ſee them well handled, let him reade the 5. chapter of <hi>Bodines methode,</hi> entituled <hi>de recto historiarum iudicio,</hi> and the firſt chapter of 
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:11275:39"/> his fift booke <hi>de Republica,</hi> which is the ſumme of all that hee writes thereof in his <hi>Methode. Peucer</hi> alſo in the 13. and 14. bookes of his diſcourſe vpon the principall ſorts of diuinations: and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his booke <hi>de Aere, aquis &amp; locis:</hi> but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>Bodin,</hi> may ſerue to expound our Poet; who in very fewe lines hath penned matter of ſo long diſcourſe.</p>

                        <hi>For in the ſacred cloſe.</hi> The poet goes on according to the ſaid deuiſion: and in few wordes emplies all that diſcourſe of <hi>Bodin:</hi> who ſaith among other matters there, that the people dwelling in the middle Regions haue more ſtrength &amp; leſſe wit then the Southerne; better partes of minde, &amp; leſſe bodily force then the Northen: &amp; are moreouer the fitteſt for gouernement of Common-wealthes, and iuſteſt in their actions. And if a man doe marke well the hiſtories of the world, he ſhall find that the greateſt &amp; moſt valiant Armies came euer out of the North: the deepeſt and ſubtileſt knowledge of Philoſophie, Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, and all other contemplatiue Artes, from the south: and the beſt gouernement, the beſt lawes, lawyers and Orators from 
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:11275:39"/> the Middle countries; and that the greateſt Empyres were foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and eſtabliſhed there, &amp;c. What reaſon there is for this, he ſheweth alſo in his fift chap. of his <hi>Meth.</hi> Looke more thereof in <hi>L. Regius, de viciſſitudine et varietate rerum.</hi> For my parte, I am of opinion that Almightie God as he hath knit and bound together the Elementes, and Creatures made of them, with a marueilous compaſſe, in number, waight and meaſure, beſt for continuance of the whole worke, and mutuall agreement of the partes; ſo he hath alſo placed the chiefe ſubtiltie and liuely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of ſpirit fartheſt from the greateſt bodily force, either in beaſt or man; for the better maintenance of humaine ſocietie in a iuſt counterpoys: and gaue the middle kinde of people a nature of eyther tempered, though if a man enter into particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar diſcourſe, hee may eaſily finde the northerne, ſoutherne and middle Nature in euery Nation. What ſay I, euery Nation? nay I dare ſay in euery one of vs, ſo fitly is Man called a little world. But the ſoutherne men, for the moſt part hauing ſo quick and liuely partes of minde in a body leſſe charged with fieſhe, they repreſent the contemplatiue and ſtudious kinde of life: the northerne that haue their wit in their fingers endes, that is, that are ſo cunning crafteſmen, inuenters of warlike engins, artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and all ſortes of needefull inſtrumentes, they may well bee likened vnto the actiue and trading life: and the middle ſort vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ciuill gouernement and politicke life: which is a meane betwixt the other two. Yet this the Poet well reſtraineth, ſaying that the northerne people alſo in theſe latter dayes haue bin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noumed for the Tongues, the Lawes, the Mathematickes, Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Oratorie, &amp; all good learning; as well as in times paſt they were, and are ſtill, for warlike valour and cunning hand-works. Not without cauſe; for in <hi>England, Scotland, Polonie, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi> and other ſuch countries, are and haue bene diuers very learned men flouriſhing: and <hi>Germany</hi> eſpecially, which is (as it were) <hi>Vulcans forge,</hi> and the <hi>Campe</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> hath brought forth many men excellent well ſeene in all kinde of learning: it were needeleſſe to name them, they are ſo wellknowne.</p>

                        <hi>For as a Citie.</hi> The laſt conſideration giues the Author occaſion to compare the world vnto a great Citie, ſuch as <hi>Paris Roan, Tolouſe, Lyons</hi> or any other like, where there are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and crafteſmen for all kind of wares, each in their ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall wardes, buying, ſelling, changing and trading one with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And euen ſo one countrie affoordeth ſugar, another ſpice, another gummes; and gold, alabaſter, Iuorie, hebenwood, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, amber, furres, tynne and ſilke, they are brought from diuers coaſtes, all the more to furniſh with thinges neceſſary this great 
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:11275:40"/> Citie of the worlde. VVhereby wee may note that no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie (bee it neuer ſo well appointed) can ſay that it needes not the commodities of another. And againe, that there is no land ſo barren, but hath ſome good thing or other which the reſt want. For euen in men wee ſee the like; there is none ſo poore but hath ſome ſpeciall gift: none ſo rich but hath neede of the pooreſt. Our Poet therefore hauing ſo fitly reſembled the world by a great Citie, he brings-in thereupon a fine example of the Perſian Queene, who (as <hi>Herodotus, Xenophon</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) called one Prouince her Iuelhouſe, another her Wardrope, &amp;c: for euen ſo may euery man ſay, that hath the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and feare of God; ſuch a man may ſaye, <hi>Peru</hi> bringes foorth Gold for me: the <hi>Moluckes</hi> or <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> Spice: <hi>Damaske,</hi> Alabaſter: and <hi>Italie,</hi> Silke: <hi>Germany</hi> ſends me great Horſes: <hi>Moſcouie,</hi> rich Furres: <hi>Arabia,</hi> ſweet Parfumes: <hi>Spaine,</hi> Saffern: <hi>Pruſſe,</hi> Amber: <hi>England,</hi> Cloath and Tinne: <hi>France,</hi> Corne and Wine. Yea more the child of God may ſay; the Earth, the Sea, the Aire and all that is therein; the Sunne, the Moone, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, are mine: for he that needeth nothing, made all things of nothing to ſerue me, and me to worſhip him. But of this let the Deuines diſcourſe more at large. He goe on with the Poet: who ſayth further, againſt the carping Atheiſt, that nothing was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in vaine, but euen the moſt vnlikely places bring foorth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good fruits, and very neceſſarie for the life of Man.

After he hath ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the land with diuers honourable termes and titles, he ſayth very truly, that it hath brought-foorth many worthie warriors, cunning workmen, and learned Schollers: more is the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, becauſe it is but a ſmall kingdome in compariſon of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia, Perſia, Tartaria, China</hi> and others. But indeede the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities thereof are moſt wonderfull. Beſides the ſeas that bound it, as on the North and Weſt the Ocean, and the Midland on the South, it hath many riuers of great name and euen little 
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:11275:41"/> ſeas: as the <hi>Roſue, Saone, Dordogne, Loire, Marne, Seine, Oiſe:</hi> and yet a great number of other leſſer ſtreames and brookes. Cities it hath, as <hi>Paris, Tolouſe, Roüan, Lyon, Bourdeaux,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of more value then diuers whole Duchies, Earldomes, or Prouinces elſewhere. There are Forts and Caſtles now ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and goodlier then euer were. As for the ciuill behauiour of the people, I report me to the iudgement of other nations. The Land for the moſt part is very fruitfull, and the aire there tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate almoſt euery where. Againſt the ſudden inuaſion of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies all is well defended by the two Seas aforeſayd, and the Alpes toward <hi>Italie,</hi> and the Pyrenes toward <hi>Spaine.</hi> More then all this, the countrie is no where troubled with Crocodiles as <hi>Aegypt</hi> is, nor with monſtrous long Serpents, or any wilde ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening beaſts, as the inner countries of <hi>Affricke</hi> are. And in ſtead of Gold and Siluer, Pearles and precious ſtones, which diuers lands barren of neceſſarie fruites abound with, it hath of Cloath, Woade, Wooll, Salt. Corne and Wine, euer-growing Mines, and euen vnwaſtable: Woade and Salt in <hi>Languedoc;</hi> and Salt againe in <hi>Guyenne;</hi> Wine in moſt places; Wooll and Corne in <hi>Prouence</hi> and <hi>Beauſſe;</hi> and in euery Prouince, but foure or fiue, good ſtore of diuers the ſayd commodities. More there are, but the Poet notes the chiefe onely, and ſuch as the neighbour countries and many far-of doe moſt of al trade-for. Hereby we are taught, and ſhould be moued with heartie thanks to acknowledge the great benefits that God hath beſtowed on vs: for the Poet rightly concludes that wee lacke nothing but peace, and peace he craueth of the Lord: with whom, and all my good countrimen, I ioyne humble ſuite from the bottome of my heart, that once again this Realme (ſometime ſo floriſhing) may enioy a ſure, that is, a iuſt and right Chriſtian peace.</p>
